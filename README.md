# Kint PHP Debugger

A WordPress plugin available for install and activate through the [WordPress Plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kint-php-debugger/).

Uses: Kint version 1.1

Why not the latest Kint version?

* Rendering is inconsistent with the video library on Know the Code - the new version wraps all of the dumps and packages them into one container.  The container is rendered fixed at the bottom of the screen.
* Composer required - the new version requires Composer to load all the files, which are extensive.  To keep it simple, this plugin does not require Composer to run the plugin.

Tested up to WordPress 5.1.
